## Description and Purpose

This document is submitted to the 2026 FSAE Electric competition's Sponsorship Proposal event. This proposal requests a realistic tiered, engineering-first technical partnership with Öhlins focused on damper validation, service/spares support, and measurable deliverables.

## Design

This document pitches Öhlins Racing/USA on becoming the team's "Official Damper and Suspension Technology Parter" via a low-risk, 12-month technical pilot with tiered options. 
It emphasizes structured engineering check-ins, guidance, and access to damper-dyno validation pathways as well as service/spares support.

The document details a testing and validation plan including what Öhlins will receive after each test day in return for the partnership. It specifies deliverables across 
engineering, recruiting, and brand activation. The document also includes a KPI/ROI measurement plan and risk mitigation/next steps plan.
